# Magic Armory mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Adds some wondrous items from tabletop

### [Belt of Mighty Hurling (Lesser)](https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Belt%20of%20Mighty%20Hurling%20(Lesser))

This thick leather belt is buckled with a bright bronze clasp in the shape of a fist. When worn, it grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and allows him to apply his Strength modifier as a bonus on attack rolls instead of his Dexterity modifier when making ranged attacks with thrown weapons.

Vendors:  
- Wilcer Garms (from A2 onwards)


### [Muleback Cords](https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Muleback%20Cords)

These thick leather cords wrap around the wearer’s biceps and shoulders. When worn, they make the wearer’s muscles appear larger than normal. The wearer treats his Strength score as 8 higher than normal when determining his carrying capacity. 

Vendors:  
- Gemyl Hawkes (A1 tavern barman)
- Arcane Weaver (A3 and onwards)

If you installed mod during the game and items are not present, just cheat them in.
