# Magic Armory mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Adds some wondrous items from tabletop

### [Handwraps](https://aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Handwraps)

Handwraps are "weapons" that apply to unarmed attacks. Only unarmed, NOT natural attacks. Fists = yes, claws = no.

So they can replace Amulet of Mighty Fists for unarmed fighters.

They go into belt slot and provide their bonus to unarmed attacks.   
You're limited in equipping only one of them. To swap to another wraps first uneqiup equipped ones.   

Basic versions (granting enhancement bonus from +1 to +5) are sold at vendors.

Finnean can transform into handwraps granting same bonuses.

If enabled, when receiving Radiance, you will receive pair of wraps matching it. They do not replace Radiance longsword, but are given alongside for the sake of compatibility.


### [Belt of Mighty Hurling (Lesser)](https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Belt%20of%20Mighty%20Hurling%20(Lesser))

This thick leather belt is buckled with a bright bronze clasp in the shape of a fist. When worn, it grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and allows him to apply his Strength modifier as a bonus on attack rolls instead of his Dexterity modifier when making ranged attacks with thrown weapons.

Vendors:  
- Wilcer Garms (from A2 onwards)


### [Muleback Cords](https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Muleback%20Cords)

These thick leather cords wrap around the wearer’s biceps and shoulders. When worn, they make the wearer’s muscles appear larger than normal. The wearer treats his Strength score as 8 higher than normal when determining his carrying capacity.

### [Boots of Levitation](https://aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Boots%20of%20Levitation)
